- Running main and tests both resulted in a segmentation fault
- CountChar and removeLeadingSpaces look like they could work, but the only test case is for indent, which failed
- Can't tell from a look where indent failed
- After sending my review, Camilla remembered to push a fix to the problem, everything worked

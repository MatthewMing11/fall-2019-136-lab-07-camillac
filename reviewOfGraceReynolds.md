- “make” and “make tests” doesn’t compile on my machine. Perhaps that’s because Mac’s may need an additional flag for doctest in the makefile so you’re probably good.
- There is an error when running make tests. Your second string has an error in the test case, the one you’re comparing the test to. (This error has been fixed)
- The parameter of your function could have been a filename so you didn’t run into errors typing in the first input string, and you could just format it how you want it in a file
- I like that you test the other functions. I wish you used main.cpp to test the indent function.
- I like your task comments. I wish there were more functional comments.
